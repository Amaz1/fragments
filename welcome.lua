	"You're going to be traveling quite a bit to find these rewards. You'll be delving deep into the " ..
	"center of the earth, and exploring the floating islands which fill the sky. For the delving, you " ..
	"know what to do. But the floating islands, they present a greater challenge. Luckly, there are some " ..
	"things that will help you.\nTo get from island to island, you will probably want the <i>" ..
	"slingshot</i> to fling yourself from island to island. But, if you do that without protection, " ..
	"you will die rapidly from the rapid speeds of impact. To stay in a healthy condition, you'll want " ..
	"to get hold of the <i>bouncer</i> as well, which should help to prevent you from " ..
	"dying ... too often.\nTo use the slingshot, simply rightclick with it while pointing at something, and " ..
	"you can either wait for 4 or 5 seconds to be slung with full force, or, if you want less force, change " ..
	"what you're holding sooner. After you've been slung, you're going to want to hold on to the bouncer, " ..
	"which should permit you to bounce without taking fall damage. Just try not to bounce off the islands!\n" ..

	"First of all, you're going to want something to show you where this tower is. You're going to need it, " ..
	"because it could be anywhere. But to find it, you're going to need to begin by going up. In the floatlands, " ..
	"at least 200 nodes above the sea, there are two precious crystals which are going to become very important " ..
	"to you. <i>Amethyst</i>, a purple crystal can be found in any normal stone, while for the blue crystal of " ..
	"<i>lapis lazuli</i>, you will have to search in the deserts of the floatlands. You're going to need " ..
	"that slingshot and that bouncer to navigate! I also recomend making some binoculars, so that you can " ..
	"scan islands to see if you can see the ores on them...\n Once you've found some lapis " ..
	"lazuli, you'll be able to make a tower locator, if you have some gold and some diamonds. You're going to need to " ..
	"find some amethyst as well, so you can make a key to get into the tower.\nTo use the tower locator, you can " ..
	"rightclick with it. You can only use it once a minute though!\n" ..
